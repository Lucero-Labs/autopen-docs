## The Real Problem

**"Can you confirm that Maria Gonzalez graduated in 2025?"**

The university employee who has to search the system. The company that waits days for a response. The student who loses opportunities because "we are verifying."

**What if degrees verified themselves?**

## The Solution

### 🎯 **Credentials That Travel with the Student**
Every approved subject, every degree issued, every developed skill becomes a **verifiable credential that the student carries forever.**

### ⚡ **Instant International Verification**
An Argentine graduate applies to Stanford. **The US university verifies the Argentine degree in 2 seconds.**

### 📊 **Total Granularity**
Not just "graduated as an engineer." But **"passed Algorithms with 9.2, interned at Google, specializing in Machine Learning."**
