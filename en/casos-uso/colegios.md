# Professional Associations: 

## The Real Problem

**"Can you confirm that Dr. Perez is licensed?"**

That phone call they make 500 times a day. The employee who has to search the system. The waiting. The risk of someone practicing without being licensed.

**What if no one ever had to call again?**

## The Solution

### 🎯 **Issue Verifiable Credentials**
Each registered professional receives a digital credential that **anyone can verify instantly**, without calling you.

### ⚡ **Total Control**
Did someone lose their registration? **You revoke the credential and it automatically becomes invalid worldwide.**

### 📊 **Complete Transparency**
You know who is using their credential, where, when, and for what. **Without them calling you to ask.**

## Real Case: Association of Architects

### **Before:**
