# SSI Engineering Internship - Lucero Labs

**Building the Future of Digital Identity**

**Duration**: Sept-Dec 2025 (4 months, extensible to 6)  
**Commitment**: 20 hours/week, hybrid (Colegiales coworking + remote)  
**Compensation**: $1,000 USD/month + $150 API credits  

## About Us

Lucero Labs modernizes trust through cutting-edge identity solutions. Our flagship product, Autopen, is a blockchain-backed digital signature platform built on QuarkID for Buenos Aires City. We're Avalanche Foundation-funded and actively moving Argentina on-chain.

**Current Impact**: Deployed in Buenos Aires universities for attendance control and certificate issuance, processing real-world digital signatures with blockchain verification.

## The Challenge

We need to modernize our Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) stack. Our current QuarkID implementation was built as a proof-of-conceptâ€”now we're scaling to serve millions of Buenos Aires residents.

**Your Mission**: Modernize QuarkID's SSI stack from proof-of-concept to production-grade infrastructure. Evaluate existing frameworks (like Hyperledger's Credo-TS), potentially build custom solutions, and ensure seamless compatibility with Buenos Aires integrations.

## What You'll Build

**Core Project**: QuarkID Stack Modernization
- Research and evaluate modern SSI frameworks (Credo-TS, Veramo, custom solutions)
- Design migration strategy from current proof-of-concept to production architecture
- Implement chosen solution with full Buenos Aires government compatibility
- Contribute improvements to the broader SSI ecosystem

**Tech Stack**
- **Primary**: TypeScript/Node.js, Go
- **Cryptography**: BBS+ signatures, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, digital signatures
- **Standards**: W3C DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, DIDComm protocol
- **Blockchain**: Sidetree protocol, Ethereum EVM, Smart Contracts

## Focus Areas (Choose Based on Interest)

**Architecture Track**: Evaluate SSI frameworks, design scalable architecture, build framework-agnostic compatibility layers

**Cryptography Track**: Upgrade signature schemes, implement selective disclosure and zero-knowledge presentations, optimize mobile performance

**Integration Track**: Mobile SDK development, government API integrations, high-throughput optimization

## Who We're Looking For

**Academic Background**: Final-year Computer Science, Software Engineering, or related field with solid theoretical foundation

**Technical Skills**
- **Required**: TypeScript/JavaScript, Node.js, Git workflows, async programming
- **Preferred**: Go, React Native, blockchain development, cryptography
- **Bonus**: Exposure to distributed systems or cryptography

**Personal Qualities**: Self-directed, strong communicator, growth mindset, impact-driven

## Application Process

**Step 1: Technical Assessment**

**Scenario**: QuarkID uses custom DID methods that Credo-TS doesn't recognize. You need to implement a resolver.

**Your Challenge**: Create a prompt to help you:
- Understand DID methods and resolvers
- Learn Credo-TS DID resolution implementation
- Design a custom resolver for QuarkID's DID format

**Deliverables**:
- AI prompt (300-400 words)
- Analysis (100-150 words): Explain your prompt structure and learning expectations

**Step 2**: Technical interview + take-home challenge review  
**Step 3**: Paid 1-week trial project ($300)

## What We Offer

- **Real Impact**: Your code serves actual government infrastructure
- **Cutting-Edge Tech**: Work with technologies 2-3 years ahead of industry
- **Open Source Fame**: Contribute to major Linux Foundation projects
- **Direct Mentorship**: Daily standups with CEO, bi-weekly deep dives
- **Career Launch**: Strong foundation for blockchain/identity career
- **Professional Environment**: Premium coworking space, flexible hybrid arrangement

## Apply

**Deadline**: August 28, 2025  
**Email**: hello@lucerolabs.xyz  
**Subject**: "SSI Engineering Internship - [Your Name]"

**Required**:
- CV highlighting relevant technical experience
- GitHub profile showcasing your best code
- Technical assessment response
- Brief cover letter explaining your interest in SSI and Lucero Labs
