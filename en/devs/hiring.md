**Compensation**: $1,000 USD/month + $150 API credits
**Location**: Hybrid (Colegiales coworking + remote)

## 1. About Lucero Labs

We are Lucero Labs, a startup modernizing trust through cutting-edge identity solutions. Our flagship product, Autopen, is a blockchain-backed digital signature platform built on QuarkID for the City of Buenos Aires.

**Our Backing**
- Funded by Avalanche Foundation
- Part of the Crecimiento movement
- Mission: Moving Argentina on-chain

**Current Impact**
- Deployed in Buenos Aires universities for attendance and certificate issuance
- Processing real-world digital signatures with blockchain verification
- Building infrastructure for Argentina’s digital transformation

## 2. The Challenge

We need to modernize our Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) stack. Our current QuarkID implementation, while functional, was built as a proof-of-concept. Now we’re scaling to serve millions of Buenos Aires residents.

**The Mission**: Modernize QuarkID’s SSI stack from proof-of-concept to production-grade infrastructure. This involves evaluating existing frameworks (like Credo-TS from Hyperledger), potentially building custom solutions, and ensuring seamless compatibility with Buenos Aires’ existing integrations.

**Why This Matters**
- Real impact: Your code will serve Buenos Aires’ population
- Open source: Contributing to Linux Foundation projects
- Cutting-edge: Working with W3C standards, DIDs, Zero-Knowledge Proofs

## 3. What You’ll Build

**Core Project: QuarkID Stack Modernization**
- Research and evaluate modern SSI frameworks (Credo-TS, Veramo, custom solutions)
- Design migration strategy from current proof-of-concept to production-grade architecture
- Implement chosen solution with full Buenos Aires government compatibility
- Contribute improvements back to the broader SSI ecosystem

**Technical Stack You’ll Master**
- **Languages**: TypeScript/Node.js (primary), Go (secondary)
- **Cryptography**: BBS+ signatures, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Digital signatures
- **Standards**: W3C DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, DIDComm protocol
- **Blockchain**: Sidetree protocol, Ethereum EVM, Smart contracts
- **Framework**: Modern SSI frameworks (Credo-TS, Veramo, or custom architecture)

## 4. Potential Focus Areas

Choose based on your interests and strengths:

**Architecture Track**
- Evaluate and compare SSI frameworks (Credo-TS vs Veramo vs custom)
- Design scalable architecture for government deployment
- Build framework-agnostic compatibility layers

**Cryptography Track**
- Update signature schemes to latest standards (BBS+, etc.)
- Implement selective disclosure and zero-knowledge presentations
- Optimize cryptographic performance for mobile devices

**Integration Track**
- Mobile SDK development for React Native
- Government API integrations
- Performance optimization for high-throughput scenarios

## 5. Your Learning Journey

- Bi-weekly deep dives: Architecture decisions and code review
- Real-time support: Slack/Discord for immediate questions

**Professional Environment**
- Premium coworking space in Colegiales
- Flexible hybrid work arrangement
- Direct access to startup decision-making
- Networking with Buenos Aires tech ecosystem

**Career Development**
- Portfolio-worthy open source contributions
- Direct experience with government-scale deployments
- Potential full-time opportunity based on performance
- Recommendation letters from funded startup founders

## 8. Application Process

**Step 1: Technical Assessment**
**Scenario**: QuarkID uses custom DID methods that Credo-TS doesn’t recognize. You need to implement a resolver.
**Background**: DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) are like decentralized domain names for identity, and different ”methods” (did:web, did:key, etc.) define how they’re created and resolved.
**Your Challenge**: You’re new to SSI and need to understand these concepts first.
Create a prompt that helps you:
- Understand what DID methods and resolvers are
- Learn how Credo-TS implements DID resolution
- Design a custom resolver for QuarkID’s DID format

**Deliverables**:
- The AI prompt (300-400 words)
- Your analysis (100-150 words): Explain why you structured the prompt this way and what you expect to learn
**We want to see**: How you approach learning unfamiliar technical domains

**Step 2: Technical Interview**
- 45-minute technical discussion
- Code review of a small take-home challenge
- Architecture and design thinking evaluation

**Step 3: Paid Trial Project**
- 1-week paid engagement ($300)
- Real contribution to QuarkID/Credo-TS integration
- Mutual evaluation of working relationship

## 9. Application Requirements

**Submit by August 28th, 2025**:
- Resume/CV highlighting relevant technical experience
- GitHub profile showcasing your best code
- Technical Prompt Response (see Step 1 above)
- Brief cover letter explaining your interest in SSI and Lucero Labs
