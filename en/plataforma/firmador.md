# Digital Signer: More Than Just a Signature

## The Signer That Knows Your Story

**Every signature tells a story.** Not just who you are, but **what authorizes you to make that decision at that moment.**

A signature without context is just a name on a paper. A signature with context is **a complete declaration of authority and responsibility.**

**Our signer includes the relevant context in every signature.**

When a doctor signs a prescription, it doesn't just matter that it's him - it matters that **he is a licensed doctor.** The document doesn't just say "Juan Pérez signed", it says **"Dr. Juan Pérez, Cardiologist, License 12345, valid until 2025, signed this prescription."**

## How It Works

### 📄 **Upload Your PDF**
Any document: contract, prescription, blueprint, authorization.

### 🎫 **Present Your Credential**
An invitation is generated. You present your verifiable credential - doctor, lawyer, parent, whatever is relevant.

### ✍️ **Instant Signature**
We generate a unique P12 certificate for you, **which only works if your credential is valid.** You sign and it's reflected instantly.

### 🔍 **Complete Verification**
Anyone can view the signed PDF with **all your relevant verifiable information.** Not just that you signed, but **what authorizes you to do so.**

## What Makes the Difference

### 🧬 **Complete Context**
- **Doctor → Prescription:** Specialty, license number, validity
- **Architect → Blueprint:** Licensing, professional registration
- **Parent → Authorization:** Verified family relationship
- **Lawyer → Power of Attorney:** License number, specialization

### 🔒 **Conditional Certificate**
Your signing certificate **only activates if your credential is valid.** Without a valid credential, no signature is possible.

### 👥 **Collaborative Signatures**
Multiple people can sign the same document. **Each with their complete context.**

### 📱 **Shareable Verification**
Public view where anyone can see the document and **all the relevant information of each signer.**

## The Change

**Traditional Signature:**
- "Signed by Juan Pérez"
- Is he really a doctor?
- Is he licensed?
- When does his license expire?

**Signature with Autopen:**
- "Signed by Dr. Juan Pérez, Cardiologist, License 12345, valid until 2025"
- **Instantly verifiable, from anywhere**


## What It's Used For

**🏥 Healthcare Professionals:** Prescriptions with specialty and license number
**🏗️ Licensed Technicians:** Blueprints with verifiable professional registration
**⚖️ Legal Professionals:** Documents with valid license number
**👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Parents:** Authorizations with verified family relationship
**🎓 Graduates:** Documents with degree and educational institution
