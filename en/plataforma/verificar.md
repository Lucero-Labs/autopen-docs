# Verifier: Automate Real-Time Decisions

## The Verifier That Acts

**We don't just verify credentials. We automate decisions.**

You can build verifiers for **any credential from any issuer** and configure what happens when someone presents them. Student discounts for university students? Exclusive access for certified professionals? **The verifier acts automatically.**

## What You Can Do

### 🎯 **Custom Verifiers**
You create verifiers for the credentials that matter to you. **Not just yours - anyone's.** Graduates of a certain university, members of a specific professional association, citizens of specific countries.

### ⚡ **Automatic Webhooks**
You configure what happens when verification is successful. **Automatic discounts, enabled access, notifications sent.** All without manual intervention.

### 🔍 **Generic Verifiers**
We build reusable verifiers that you can configure for your specific needs. **Plug and play for common cases.**

### 📊 **Transparent Dashboard**
You see the status of all verifications in real time. **Who verified what, when, and what actions were triggered.**

## Real Cases

### 🎓 **Student Discounts**
- Verifier for "University X Student"
- Webhook: Automatically apply 20% discount
- **Result:** Customer presents student credential → discount applied instantly

### 🏥 **Professional Access**
- Verifier for "Licensed Doctor"
- Webhook: Enable access to restricted area
- **Result:** Doctor scans QR → automatic access without security personnel

### 🌍 **Regional Offers**
- Verifier for "Buenos Aires Resident"
- Webhook: Show specific local offers
- **Result:** Local user → sees offers others don't
