# Trust Over IP: How Digital Trust Works

## The Real Problem

Imagine you need to prove you're a doctor. Today you have to:
- Carry your physical diploma (what if it gets lost?)
- Ask them to call the university (what if they don't answer?)
- Show your professional ID (what if it's expired?)
- Hope they trust you

**Wouldn't it be better if you could prove it instantly, from anywhere in the world, without depending on anyone?**

## Trust Over IP: The Internet of Trust

Trust Over IP is exactly that: **turning the Internet into a place where trust is instant, verifiable, and global.**

Like when you use a credit card anywhere in the world and it works automatically. But for EVERYTHING: your identity, your degrees, your certifications, your permits.

## The Three Roles That Change Everything

### üè¢ **Issuer**
**Your university, your government, your employer.**

Instead of giving you a paper that can be lost or forged, they give you a **verifiable digital credential**. It's like a diploma, but impossible to forge and instantly verifiable.

*Example: The University of Buenos Aires issues your law degree as a digital credential. Forever, from anywhere, you can prove you studied there.*

### üë§ **Holder (You)**
**You store your credentials in your digital wallet.**

Like a normal wallet, but instead of plastic cards, you have credentials that **no one can hack, steal, or forge**. And you decide what to show and to whom.

*Example: When applying for a job, you show only your degree and experience. Not your address, not your age, no irrelevant information.*

### ‚úÖ **Verifier**
**Anyone who needs to confirm something about you.**

In seconds they can verify that your credentials are real, without calling anyone, without papers, without intermediaries. **Instant trust.**

*Example: The hospital where you want to work scans your credential and in 2 seconds confirms you are a graduated doctor, with a current specialization.*

## Why It's Revolutionary

**Before:**
- "Trust me, here's my paper"
- Manual and slow verification
- Easy to forge
- You depend on third parties

**Now:**
- "Verify it yourself, here's the cryptographic proof"
- Automatic and instant verification
- Impossible to forge
- You don't depend on anyone

## The World to Come

Imagine a world where:

- **Upon arriving in a country:** Your passport is automatically verified
- **When applying for a loan:** Your credit history is instantly confirmed
- **Upon entering a building:** Your access permit is validated without cards
- **When buying alcohol:** Your age is verified without showing your address

**Everything instant. Everything secure. Everything paperless.**
